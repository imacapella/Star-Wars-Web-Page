          Star Wars: The Phantom Menace
          <br><br>
          The saga begins with a child Anakin Skywalker, the future Darth Vader, being discovered by legendary Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, who senses the boy's enormous potential. It is here that Skywalker first encounters the young Obi-Wan Kenobi, who himself is still but a pupil. As the first film unfolds, key characters appear, such as Padmé Amidala, R2-D2, C-3PO, Yoda, and the villainous Sheev Palpatine, who is a mere Senator in the Galactic Republic at the time. After a debate with the Jedi Council, one which includes the possible resurface of the Sith in addition to Skywalker, it is decided that Anakin will not be trained as a Jedi. At the end of the film, the Sith, Darth Maul, leads an attack against the Jedi on Naboo, and only the tragic death of Qui-Gon at his hands persuades the Jedi to reconsider their decision. Anakin Skywalker then becomes Obi-Wan's apprentice in the ways of the Force.

          Star Wars: Attack of the Clones
          <br><br>
          Between TPM and AotC, Palpatine brought Dooku on as his new apprentice and began using him to destabilize the galaxy and start grabbing more and more power. Dooku worked with the Trade Federation to expand their droid army and was heavily involved in the Separatist movement to provide an antagonist to the Republic. Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas had enough foresight to understand that the Republic would eventually need an army and so he secretly commissioned the clones from the Kaminoan. Around the time of The Phantom Menace, Dooku had Sifo-Dyas murdered so he and Sideous could assume control of the clone production. It was at this point that they had the inhibitor chips modified to add Order 66 to them. The Sith had control of both armies involved in the Clone Wars from the very beginning. Sideous used Dooku to gather more and more systems to the Separitist side, thus causing panic in the Republic. This panic lead the senate to look for strong leadership. In doing that, they turned to Palpatine who manipulated Jar Jar into starting a motion to grant him emergency power. The senate took the bait, granted Palpatine the extra power and Palpatine used it to bring out the clones and position the Jedi as officers in the Grand Army of the Republic.

          Star Wars: Revenge of The Sith
          <br><br>
          The Clone Wars raged on, further destabilizing the galaxy and causing it's people to become increasingly afraid and hungry for strong leadership. As the war spread, so did the GAR, positioning Palpatines's superior troops to secure the galaxy when the time was right. As the war continued, so did the trend of the senate granting Palpatine more and more emergency power to cut through the bureaucracy and hopefully end the war. By this time, Anakin had become sufficiently powerful and distressed that he would be receptive Palpatine's dark side seduction and would make him the most powerful apprentice that Seditious had ever had. Once Sideous had Anakin in his grasp, he finally activated the trap that he had been setting for decades. He executed Order 66, which wiped out all the Jedi and finally gave him his revenge. Order 66 also gave him an army spread across the galaxy to keep his soon to be subjects in line. Palpatine had gathered enough political power to himself that he was then able to declared himself Emperor and not only could nobody stop him, but they applauded his decision because it took them one step closer to ending the war. Once the first Galactic Empire had been established, Emperor Palpatine dispatched Darth Vader to wipe out the Separatist council, shut down the droid armies and singlehandedly end the Clone Wars.
          By the end of Revenge of the Sith, all of Palpatine's initial goals had been accomplished. He brought about the end of the Jedi, brought the galaxy to a state where it welcomed his rule, gathered the majority of the political power in the galaxy to himself, and spread the clone army across the galaxy to subjugate his new empire.
